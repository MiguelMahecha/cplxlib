# Complex Library

This library is for the first lab of the CNYT class. It defines functions to perform
the following operations on complex numbers:

- Addition
- Subtraction
- Multiplication
- Division
- Conjugate
- Modulus
- Polar to Cartesian representation
- Cartesian to Polar representation
- Get phase of complex number

In order to test the project

```shell
git clone https://github.com/MiguelMahecha/cplxlib.git
cd cplxlib
python cplx_text.py
```

If you wish to add the functions to your project, this should work

```shell
cd <root of your project>
git clone https://github.com/MiguelMahecha/cplxlib.git
rm -rf cplx/.git # so that you can use your own repo
```
You should now have a module called ```cplxlib``` that you can use on your project

$$
\int_{0}^{1} x^2 \, dx
